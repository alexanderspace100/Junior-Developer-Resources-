# Resume Resources: 
> Let’s get away from boring traditional resume, check out these resources [here] (https://github.com/namesjames/Junior-Developer-Resources/blob/master/web-resources.md)!


## What will keep your resume at the “top of the stack”: 
* Eye-catching theme / design (no boring word docs) - but keep it clean and simple!
* Perfect grammar (no errors / typos)
* Personal branding (sell yourself!)
* Tailored resumes (job specific)
* Leverage your personal projects as job experience 

## The Interview

#### How to greet the interviewer:
When greeting the interviewer be confident, make sure to shake his/her hand firmly and make eye contact (this is very important in showing them your confidence and professionalism). If you do not have a portfolio for your resume, put it in a dark or beige folder, carrying it professionally by your side. Come prepared with whatever you need to show how you're qualified.

#### Tech Interview Questions You May Expect: [Here](https://github.com/namesjames/Junior-Developer-Resources/blob/master/Interview_Questions.md)

### Questions For You To Ask
#### Three Things You Wish to Achieve When Asking Your Questions:

* Demonstrate your interest in the employer.
* Make sure the interviewer has no reservations about you.
* Find out if you feel the employer is the right fit for you (you’re interviewing them!)

#### Examples:

* What’s your feedback mechanism? (Do you use pull requests prior to merging it?)
* How does code get into production? (look for a nice repeatable process) 
* Ask about culture? (is this a strict 9-5, is there flexibility?)
* Do you have regular reviews / feedback for your employees? 
* What’s your current technology stack? (does it differ from the job description) I need details!
* What are your current application pain points? (What are the characteristics of the performance issues in your application)
* Ask about pairing (what are the organizational views on pairings, how much time spent)
* What are the organizational views on testing (may not always be applicable) 
 
#### Questions to Avoid:

Avoid too much ‘chit-chat’ during technical interviews (but look for well-placed jokes to cut tension in interviews...only as seen fit). Wait until the next interview to ask about salary, benefits (vacation, 401k, etc.)

### Interview Attire: (Dress for success) how to look and behave:
```Over dressing is just as easy as under dressing. Evaluate where you’re interviewing and the culture they have set in place, i.e. don’t interview at a start-up in a 3 piece suit and don’t interview at a large corporate enterprise in jeans and t-shirt. This area of focus should be least important to you, just make sure you shower, and are wearing clean, ironed clothes and you’ll be all set!```

```Make sure your phone is off / silent - also, do not be caught checking it - this is a deal breaker and your interview will be crushed as soon as you do! *```

#### Women: 
* Tips: don’t overdo it with accessories (one strong piece - like a chunky, bright necklace - or a couple small, delicate pieces), and a silk scarf is always nice if it looks right with the outfit! If you are not comfortable in heels, go with flats (the more comfortable you are, the more confidence you will exude). Err on the side of conservative, traditional attire and dressing up rather than dressing down (but be careful not to overdress depending on the company that you are interviewing with). For women, this means a dark or neutral-colored suit, a tailored, dressy blouse and matching, mid-heel pumps or flats. Wearing a nice watch, with the correct time shows you are punctual and professional!

#### Men:
* Tips: if you’re interviewing at a startup a button down and slacks / dark jeans and leather shoes (either boat shoes or desert boots) work great. As far as accessories - no exposed necklaces, it’s advised to remove any earrings for interviews unless you have gauges (might look gross without). A nice watch always looks great, make sure the time is correct and it’s on your left wrist. If you’re interviewing somewhere more corporate, again button down but tucked-in, slacks / dress pants, leather shoes (polished) stick with one color of leather - don’t wear black shoes, brown belt, and silver watch, try to stay consistent. Don’t over-do the cologne and always iron / lint brush your outfit. 

## Negotiating: 

* How do I turn a part time contract into a full time position?

* Whats an appropriate asking amount for a junior developer in Colorado?

* Where can I calculate how much I will need to relocate?

* How can I negotiate working remotely?

* How can I negotiate working out of a different office location?

## Personality Traits:

* Curiosity (intellectual) -  Curious people are often quirky and think outside the box. Employers are looking for an employee whose forever learning and never satisfied sitting still. The goal is to find employees challenge their co-workers and the firm itself to continue rapid expansion and the development of new skills.

* Competitiveness - Competitive people exude hustle, grind and grit. They’re perfect for startups because they don’t let go. They’re not afraid to work hard to reach a goal and when setbacks hit, it’s in their character to dust off themselves (and their company).

* Integrity - People who value integrity are a perfect fit for any company. You can be as smart and competitive as possible but it will hurt your odds if you lack integrity. Being honest, moral, and holding high ethical standards are very desirable for a company of any size.

# Communication / Feedback:

* Sharing, Input and Dialogue - Give feedback on the information you receive. Make sure you receive feedback, answers, and comments from managers and keep a strong communication loop. 

* Make Objectives and Goals Public -  Publish company, team, and personal goals online and make them visible to all. Google’s OKR Process (Objectives and Key Results)

* Establish Regular Processes - Companies no longer want big ‘information blasts’, they’re looking for granular real-time updates. Make sure your communication is on a weekly process with defined rules for all involved.

* Listening - Listening is often more important than publishing any sort of information. Being a good listener can help lead to being a good communicator.
