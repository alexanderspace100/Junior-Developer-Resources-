# Hack Your Search

The job market for junior developers is becoming increasingly saturated and harder to navigate. I'm in the process of compiling the ultimate all-in-one resource for all junior developers to utilize. From drafting your initial resume, to negotiating your final salary, and everything in-between! 

I want this project to remain completely open and available for all to contribute. As you go through the search, feel free to pass along any advice, share interview questions you've encountered (ethically), resumes/cover letters that've recieved high response rates from, and anything else that you may have found useful in your search. 

Happy Hunting!
