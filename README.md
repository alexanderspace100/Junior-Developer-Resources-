# Junior-Developer-Resources
### Objective:
The job market for junior developers is becoming increasingly saturated and harder to navigate. I'm in the process of compiling the ultimate all-in-one resource for all junior developers to utilize. From drafting your initial resume, to negotiating your final salary, and everything in-between! 

I want this project to remain completely open and available to all to contribute. As you go through the search, feel free to share interview questions you've encountered (ethically), resumes/cover letters that've recieved high response rates, and anything else that you may have found useful in your search. 

ðŸ”Ž Happy Hunting!
